When server is in LISTEN mode, ONLY V(ack_ready_sem) if the packet is MSG_SYN, otherwise drop.
If we receive SYN in network handler:
  - if state == LISTEN:
    - V(ack_ready_sem)
    - Change state to CONNECTING
    - set addr and port
  - if state != LISTEN:
    - if addr and port match:
      - drop
    - else:
      - SEND MSG_FIN
If we receive MSG_FIN in network handler:
  - if state == CLOSING:
     - send MSG_ACK


Closing connections:
1. close connection function
If we receive MSG_SYN OR MSG_SYNACK in network handler:
  - if state == CONNECT_WAIT:
    - if MSG_SYNACK:
      - V(ack_ready_sem)
    - else:
      - drop
  - if state == WAIT:
    - if MSG_ACK:
      - V(ack_ready_sem)
    - else:
      - drop



KENTA's NOTES:
make sure you don't destroy in receive after 7 retries (ie exit)
In client_create:
  - when transition from connect_wait to close_rcv, set SOCKET_BUSY error and
    destroy
  - assume: In network handler, receiving MSG_FIN always transitions to
    CLOSE_RCV
