Known issues:
- When we have many bound ports, it takes a long time to create a new bound port because we do a linear scan on an array to find a spot for the new bound port
- We drop some packets after the number of consecutive sends reaches the order of 100s and 1000s. This is alleviated however by adding sleep statements of 10 milliseconds between sends.
